# Aquiferst

Tackling water security challenges by increasing the efficiency of water irrigation systems through the use of predictive analysis trained with NASA databases in conjunction with ground-based sensors installed on-site.

Over the 48 hours, we developed:
(a) an algorithm trained using databases such as SMAP and IMERG to estimate the correct parameters for farming, e.g. temperature, humidity, moisture, and represent it in a normalised value combined with suggested actions
(b) ground sensor device made using ESP32 with a Wi-Fi antenna that connects to DHT11 and a Moisture sensor enclosed in a custom 3d printed housing that can be inserted into the ground, all of which relays data back to a local server

(c) a demo for the irrigation system that uses a dual-reservoir system to mix water and fertiliser at a controlled rate

Our system is intended to be simple, scalable and plug-n-play. The normalised scoring of soil quality combined with the suggested list of potential remedies provides actionable advice for farmers to take. The open-sourced and readily available hardware means this solution can be made at scale and adapted to farms from small to large scale. Finally, we will work with existing industry leaders to ensure our devices work with existing irrigation machinery to ensure it is as easy as possible for farmers to adopt the technologies for smart farming.

By bridging the gap between vast datasets and practical agricultural needs, we make data, often incomprehensible, meaningful and accessible to those who need it most.
